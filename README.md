# related-artists-app

Little ReactJS project that you can check out:

https://related-artists-app.tommasogangemi.vercel.app/

Unfortunately the API doesn't allow Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for api calls from the client side. 
If you want to check out the project you can by using the "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin" chrome extension and it will work just as intended.

Built with NextJS and styled using React Bootstrap this project features async functions, API calls and React state and component management.

Have fun!
