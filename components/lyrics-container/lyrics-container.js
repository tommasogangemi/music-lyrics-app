					Say your prayers, little one Don't forget, my son To include everyone
					Tuck you in, warm within Keep you free from sin 'Til the sandman, he
					comes Sleep with one eye open Gripping your pillow tight Exit light
					Enter night Take my hand We're off to never-never land Somethings
					wrong, shut the light Heavy thoughts tonight And they aren't of Snow
					White Dreams of war, dreams of liars Dreams of dragon's fire And of
					things that will bite, yeah Sleep with one eye open Gripping your
					pillow tight Exit light Enter night Take my hand We're off to
					never-never land Now I lay me down to sleep Now I lay me down to sleep
					I pray the Lord my soul to keep I pray the Lord my soul to keep If I
					die before I wake If I die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to
					take I pray the Lord my soul toâ€¦
